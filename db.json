time to take my Shukuchi out for a ride. It was a warm weather. It does look like we got a short-break from winter. I took motorways until Eindhovan to skip the seen places. As planned from there, I took windy roads to reach Limburg, Belgium. Since it is winter time, it was getting dark soon. I had another hour and a half ride when it was 4 o'clock. I had to give up and turn back home from a near border village called Weert. I really like the village Weert and the individual houses with car port and garages. I remembered the plan that I had initially to buy an individual house with garden and car port or shed for my Shukuchi. So that it will be a workshop afterwards for I have the Shukuchi maintanance.
