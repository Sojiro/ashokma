I have recently bought a Macbook Pro mid 2012 laptop for around &euro; 550. Though it is not a new one, I came along with GreenChoice Refurb label on and with one year warrenty (3 months for the battery) just like as the new one in the stores. The configurations are as follows:

```vim
MacBook Pro (13-inch, Mid 2012)
Processor: 2,5 GHz Intel Core i5
Memory: 4 GB 1600 MHz DDR3
Hard drive 500GB
Optical drive: DVD-Writer
Screen: 13.3 inch
Maximum resolution: 1280x800
Graphics : Intel HD Graphics 4000 1536 MB

```

I have to admit that I am pretty much impressed the way it performs with this tiny 4GB RAM. O_O The main reason I bought this laptop is to try the Macbook in general.

There are some cases where it tries to open applications for sometime. But, still it opens it up and once there are up and running, it does not lag much. That is pretty impressive for the 4GM RAM.

As per the specifications, it has two memory slots currently with 2 x 2GB card that can be replaced with 2 x 4GB card making the RAM size 8GB as max. I might extend it later point in time.

The one I have has been upgraded to the latest Mojave 10.14.3 version by the seller. As soon as I was connected to the internet, I got a software update notification to download the latest MacOS Catalina but it is a pity that I could not upgrade to it due to file system format restrictions.

> The hardware or the file system where you wanna install the Catalina has to be in APFS format. >_O
