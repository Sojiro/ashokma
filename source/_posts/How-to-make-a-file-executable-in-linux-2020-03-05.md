As we do most of the things command line in linux, we could make a file executable by doing the same.

```sh
chmod +x AshKeys.war
```

Recently, I had to make our application (spring boot `war` file) executable. This came in handy. \O/

**Tip:** Use `-x` to undo the same executable change applied on a file.
