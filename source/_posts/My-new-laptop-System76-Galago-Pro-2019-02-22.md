Few days back I got my most awaiting laptop Galago Pro from System76. To be honest, I was stalking them for long time. Whenever I think of buying my own personal machine, I go to their site and do window shopping. They have this very nice checkout option where you can select most of the configurations and extend it bit more. I often found myself over there doing the same and at the end after seeing the total price at the bottom, with a sigh, I close my browser.

This was going on for a while until I saved enough amount to go for my own developer machine. It was exciting to do the quote and order it from System76. The configuration is:

    Pop!_OS 18.10 (64-bit) with full-disk encryption 	
    14″ Matte FHD 1080p Matte FHD Display 	
    3.9 GHz i5-8265U (1.6 up to 3.90 GHz - 6MB Cache – 4 Cores – 8 Threads) 	
    16 GB Dual Channel DDR4 at 2400MHz (2× 8 GB)
    250 GB M.2 SSD
    1 TB 2.5″ Solid State Hybrid Drive
    WiFi up to 867 Mbps + Bluetooth 	
    2 Year Limited Parts and Labor Warranty
    3 Day Rush Assembly Service

    Total : $1,480.66

In addition, I had to pay around &euro; 290, due to Dutch customs T_T. I was expecting that anyway.

Yes, I opted for a day 3 day rush assembly. I could not wait to get hold of it ^_^. It was here within a week and half and I could be able to track the package in UPS site from System76 package tracking section.

I like the thinking of reusable package. It was compact and uptight. Next thing was the welcome card with some stickers. It is so cool! I was not expecting it in the package though.
