I am busy with my work lately. So, I could not able to post regularly >\_<. Anyways, here goes!

CSS transform property is amazing and it helps creating our own kind-of animations. I have recently came across a code snippet and wanted to share it with you guys.

The html goes like this.

![CSS Transform HTML Code](./css-transform-html.svg)

and the css goes like this.

![CSS Transfrom CSS Code](./css-transform-css.svg)

I have tried the piece of code and it works great! ^\_^

> **Note:** I am exploring the css by myself. It is amazing that we can do a lot of dynamic stuffs with it. As mentioned, code snippets are from online or people I follow in social networks. \O/
