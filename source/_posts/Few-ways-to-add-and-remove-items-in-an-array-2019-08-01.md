There more than one way to add an item to an array and remove an item from an array in JavaScript. Let's see how can we do that in this post.

## `push` and `pop` methods

> **Note:** `push` inserts the elements at the end whereas `pop` pops out the top one that is the last item in the array.

## `shift` and `unshift` methods

> **Note:** `shift` removes the first element of an array whereas `unshift` does exact the opposite.

> **Tip:** It is called `shift` because once the method is called the items of an array shifts one position left if one pictures the array horizontally. \O/
