Most of us encounter a situation where an SVG is pixel perfect for re-use but there is one slight thing is missing. The color of the SVG has to be different >\_O. I have recently encountered this situation. Instead of just duplicating the SVG file and editing the color to desired one (I knew that was the easy one >\_<), I spent some time looking for options to do it in CSS only because duplication did not feel right. Vola! \O/

I found it and I want to share it with you guys. Using this online tool, we can create a `filter` property value that will convert/transform an SVG to our desired color!

> **P.S:** This helped me to transform the SVG icons into desired colors ^\_^

Hope this helps you guys too!
